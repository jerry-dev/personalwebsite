As of writing this, this challenge was by far the most demanding application I’ve ever built. It required me to utilize the Flux architecture pattern (single store in this case) for state management, localStorage for local data caching, and various other design patterns such as container/presentation, Publish/Subscribe (a helper pattern to the Flux architecture). I also took full advantage of the new import assertions web API for modular CSS and JSON. Like with all projects, I learned a lot of new approaches to solving problems, and feel that this project more so than any other, raised my skills the most.",

Unfortunately, the design was not responsive, nor did it come with any image assets nor data. Making up for these missing elements was a pretty significant challenge for me, especially finding image assets, but I prevailed. I research many different UI design patterns to help me incorporate a responsive design. The data modeling aspect wasn’t very difficult, but I did make mistakes that needed to be rectified later on, even after the data was hosted on MongoDB Atlas.<br/><br/>While working on this application, I came across some issues with Chart.js 2 that required me to upgrade to Chart.js 3, which is a breaking change with Chart.js 2 . I had to research and update my notes on Chart.js. I also decided to utilize React Hooks as well as using the hookifed approach to redux-react. The images for the food are served via a CDN (Imagekit.io), while the student profiles come from a public API.
