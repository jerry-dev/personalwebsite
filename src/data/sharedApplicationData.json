As of writing this, this challenge was by far the most demanding application I’ve ever built. It required me to utilize the Flux architecture pattern (single store in this case) for state management, localStorage for local data caching, and various other design patterns such as container/presentation, Publish/Subscribe (a helper pattern to the Flux architecture). I also took full advantage of the new import assertions web API for modular CSS and JSON. Like with all projects, I learned a lot of new approaches to solving problems, and feel that this project more so than any other, raised my skills the most.",
